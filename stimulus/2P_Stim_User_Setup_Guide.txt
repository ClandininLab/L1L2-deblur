*************************************

1. Turn on the Optiplex 9010 computer. Log into the ClandininLab account. 

2. Connect to the SNI server: In the Start menu, right-click on ThisPC and click Map Network Drive. 
	Type in \\sni-storage.stanford.edu\group\trc and check the box "connect using different credentials."
	Sign in using your Stanford email and password.

3. In your imaging directory, make a new date folder (must be in the form "YYMMDD"). In this folder, you will save 
	all the stimulus and imaging data collected today that you want to analyze. Within the date folder, create a folder 
	for your first fly (in the form "YYMMDD_flyN"). Later on, make a new folder for each new fly you image. 

4. Set up the LightCrafter:
	a. Plug cables (red tape) into the power, USB and HDMI ports.
	b. The LightCrafter logo should be displayed when the power is plugged in (but disappear after you plug in USB).

	c. Right-click on the desktop and select NVIDIA Control Panel. 
		i. On the left menu, go to "Set up multiple displays". Right-click on the rectangle representing the LightCrafter
		   (it should still be #2) and click "make primary monitor." The asterisk should mark this appropriately.
		ii. Under "Rotate display", the LightCrafter orientation should be landscape.
		iii. On the left menu, go to "Display" >> "Change resolution"
		iv. Set the computer monitor screen resolution to 1920 x 1080 at refresh rate 100Hz. 
		v. Set LightCrafter resolution to 1280 x 800 (native) and refresh rate 60Hz. 

	NOTE: From here, windows you open on the computer may appear on the LightCrafter instead of on  
	      the computer monitor. To move the window back to the computer monitor, hit Alt+Space+m on the keyboard
	      and use the arrow keys. If Alt+Space+m doesn't select your window, hit Alt+Tab until that window is selected. 

	d. Navigate to C:\Texas Instruments-DLP\DLPLCR4500GUI-3.0.1 and open the LightCrafter4500 application. 
	e. DLP LightCrafter 4500 Control Software-3.0.1 should open. System Control panel should display green and "Connected." 

		TIP: If Forced Swap is red, unplug the Lightcrafter and plug it back in again.
	 	Close all the programs and restart them. Check that the settings in NVIDIA Control Panel are still correct.

	f. Adjust for these settings:
		1) Operating Mode: Pattern Sequence 
		2) LED Driver Control: [R G B] = [0 0 200]
		3) LED Selection: Manual, check Blue, hit Set
		4) Sequence Settings Tab -> Sequence Settings Panel: Pattern Source = Video Port, Trigger Mode = Vsync
		5) Individual Pattern Settings: under 'Choose Color' pick Blue, set Bit Bepth to 6
		6) Select G0-G5, check 'Clear DMD after exposure', click 'Add Pattern to Sequence' (add the pattern 3 times)
		7) Timing: Pattern exposure = Pattern period = 3000
		   Pattern exposure = exposure time of one pattern, (Pattern exposre <= Pattern period).  
	 	   Important: pattern period must be < (refresh rate)/#patterns, e.g. at a 100Hz refresh rate, pattern period < 10000us/3 = 3333
		8) Click Send 
		9) Under the tab 'Pattern Sequence Start/Stop/Pause', hit "Validate Sequence." Red circle should turn green.

	g. Go back to NVIDIA Control Panel. Set LC resolution to 912 x 1140 at refresh rate 100Hz. You may need to make a custom setting.
	h. Go back to the LightCrafter Control Software. Under 'Pattern Sequence Start/Stop/Pause', hit Play. 
	   The LightCrafter should be emitting blue light.

5. In the folder 2p-stim-code, open adjustResolution.txt. Set the font to 72-size letters. 
	Move the text off the right edge of the screen to present it on the LightCrafter. 
	Adjust the LightCrafter lens until the words come into focus. Then move the file back to the computer monitor.

6. Screw the visual stimulus filters onto the lens of the LightCrafter. Try to do this without changing the focus of the lens.

7. Plug the NIDAQ USB into this computer to sync it with the imaging computer and the photodiode. 

8. Open Matlab and type in 'daq.getDevices' into the MATLAB command line. After a few seconds, it should list a device ID ('Dev1') and 
	several types of input/output channels.

9. Navigate to 'C:\Users\ClandininLab\Documents\2p-stim-code'. 
   
   Run screensizeTest.m from the MATLAB command line. Check the alignment of the projected image onto the stimulus screen. 
   A full field blue square should be displayed on the screen. In addition, a much smaller square should fall on the photodiode.
   Turn off the lights. The large square should cover the entire screen. Look directly into the photodiode; the small blue square 
   should cover the photodiode lens completely.  ***NOTE: you must have an argument here - screensizeTest(1) or screensizeTest (2) -
   whichever shows up on the lightcrafter. You must then use this argument when using playstimmain
     
  **TIPS: 
	If the image looks crooked with respect to the screen, try loosening or tightening the silver screws by a half-turn on the black piece 
        that holds the legs of the LightCrafter. If you loosen the black piece, it will be able to move up and down slightly, 
        but it should be stable in the down position and will help straighten the image with respect to the screen.
        Keep the LightCrafter legs tightly fitted into the black piece (don't loosen the small black knobs above and below).
	   
	If the image is a bit high with respect to the screen, gently push the LighCrafter lens upwards, which shifts the image downward.

10. Check that the signal-to-noise ratio on the photodiode is high by running playStimMain. Play a full field flash stimulus (e.g. 300msFullFieldFlash)
   	for a few seconds and then hit ESC. A figure should pop up - this plot shows the photodiode voltage readout over time. The light epochs should 
	be clearly separated from the noise level in the dark epochs. The light epoch amplitude typically lies above 0.1V.

11. playStimMain.m is the stimulus presentation program. Run the program (type 'playStimMain' in the command window) and 
	follow the instructions it prints in the command window.


** IMPORTANT Precautions **

	*Syncing the imaging and stimulus computer*

	Make sure to set up the triggers on the Leica software before you record any data you want to save. 
	Make sure to stop any stimulus that is currently running before starting a recording. 
	You can hit "Start Record" on the Leica software any time prior to starting a stimulus in playStimMain.m.
	
	*STOPPING AND SAVING DATA*

	Stop the stimulus manually by pressing any key EXCEPT for 'Enter' after the imaging is completed. ESC is a good go-to option. 
	If you forget, the stimulus will stop automatically after running for the duration you specify at the start of the program + 1 minute buffer time.
	Either way, you will be given the option of saving the data. 

	*ENTERING METADATA*

	When the program says, 'Enter the name of this time series in the .lif file:', make sure to enter the name of the time series 
	as displayed under the 'Experiments' tab in the Leica software, which will be 'LDM_<some number>'. 
	The time series name you enter must match the name in the Leica Software because this how the analysis code knows which 
	stimulus data to match this imaging data set to. 

	Next, the program will save stim.mat in a new folder with the same name as that of the time series. 
	The program will prompt you to select the fly folder in which to save this time series folder in. 

	If you enter a time series name that already exists in the fly folder or do not provide a name, a generic name will be assigned
	in the form of a date-time string: 'yymmdd_HH_MM_SS'. You must go back into stim.mat and edit the name:
		1. Go into the default folder that the program created
		2. Load stim.mat 
		3. Change the value of the field 'imDataName' to the actual name of the time series (e.g. LDM_001)
		4. Make sure the field 'fileloc' is set to the correct file path 
		5. Resave the struct by typing the following into the command window: save stim obj
